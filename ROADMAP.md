## Programme

**Title:** Reinforcement Learning as a Numerical Approach to Stochastic
Optimal Control under Market Frictions.

**Mission:** a unified, pedagogically structured, publication-grade Python
platform for rough stochastic volatility — simulation, multilevel Monte
Carlo pricing, market frictions, and risk-aware RL hedging. Every module is
individually citable; every numerical claim in code or docs must be backed
by a run that actually happened.

**Author:** Michael Lumor, Department of Mathematics, University of Salford
(independent research programme; ORCID 0009-0000-0326-3891).

## Layer 1 — Stochastic simulation core (complete, 1 known issue)

Cholesky-exact fBm, BLP hybrid scheme, rBergomi and rough Heston path
simulation, Hurst estimation from realised variance. Four sections, figures
to `output/`.

### KNOWN ISSUE L1-1 — Volterra normalisation (logged 2026-06-12)

`fbm_hybrid` produces a process with **Var(B^H_1) ≈ 0.89** (measured,
n = 128, 3000 paths, H = 0.1), but `rough_bergomi_paths` uses the
compensator −½η²t^{2H}, which assumes Var = t^{2H} = 1. Consequence:
**E[V_t] ≈ 0.82·ξ₀ at η = 1.9** — an ~18% forward-variance bias. Note the
empirical 0.89 also disagrees with the un-normalised Riemann–Liouville
theory value 1/(2H·Γ(H+½)²) ≈ 2.25, so the hybrid implementation is
internally inconsistent too (suspect: double-subtraction in the
`smooth_corr` loop).

**Impact:** cosmetic for Layer 1's path plots; fatal for pricing — which is
why Layer 1b has its own verified Volterra engine and does **not** import
Layer 1's.

**Fix plan:** rewrite `fbm_hybrid` against the κ=0 weights in
`layer1b_mlmc_asian.volterra_weights` (vectorised, FFT), normalise so
Var(W̃_t) matches the discrete formula, and switch the rBergomi compensator
to the discrete variance. **Acceptance test:** empirical Var(W̃_T) within
MC noise of the discrete v_n; max_t |E[V_t]/ξ₀ − 1| within 3 s.e. at
N = 100k. (These are exactly Layer 1b §1's checks — reuse them.)

## Layer 1b — MLMC Asian pricing under rough Bergomi (v0.1 complete)

**File:** `layer1b_mlmc_asian.py` · four sections · figures to `output/` ·
flags `--section {1..4}`, `--no-show`, `--quick`.

**Engine:** κ=0 optimal-discretisation Volterra scheme (BLP family),
FFT convolution, pure function of Brownian increments → **exact MLMC
coupling** (coarse = pairwise-summed fine increments). Lognormal
compensator uses the **discrete** variance v_i = 2H·dt·Σg², so
E[V_t] = ξ₀ exactly at every level. Log-Euler asset, trapezoidal arithmetic
Asian call. Defaults: H=0.10, η=1.50, ρ=−0.70, ξ₀=0.04, S0=K=100, T=1,
r=0, n₀=32 (BFG SPX calibration ≈ (0.07, 1.9, −0.9) noted as the wilder
real-world regime).

**Validation (all passed, 2026-06-12):**
- Var(W̃_T): empirical 0.8496 vs discrete 0.8529 (continuum t^{2H} = 1.0 —
  the 15% gap at n=256 is rough-vol slow convergence, and is why the
  discrete compensator matters).
- Forward variance: max_t |E[V_t]/ξ₀ − 1| = 0.034, within MC noise (~0.039).
- η=0 European vs Black–Scholes: z = 0.53.
- Telescoping consistency check < 0.51 on every run.

**Measured results (N = 20k main / 12k sweep, L = 5–6):**

| H | measured β | pathwise bound 2H |
|---|---|---|
| 0.05 | 0.125 | 0.10 |
| 0.10 | 0.226 | 0.20 |
| 0.20 | 0.422 | 0.40 |
| 0.35 | 0.721 | 0.70 |

- **β tracks 2H across the roughness spectrum — the pathwise bound is
  tight.** The Asian time-average buys no extra variance decay: the Volterra
  strong error is a slowly-decaying common factor the average cannot cancel.
- α is **unmeasurable** at this N (|E[Y_l]| ≈ 0.01–0.04 vs s.e. ≈ 0.02);
  level bias is already small at n₀ = 32. The code flags noise-dominated
  regressions explicitly.
- Adaptive MLMC (Giles): ε = 0.2 → L=2, cost 7.1e5; ε = 0.1 → L=3, 3.1e6;
  ε = 0.05 → L=7, 1.6e8; ε = 0.025 → L=7, 6.4e8. Price ≈ 4.17–4.20
  (ATM Asian; BS European anchor 7.97).
- **Honest headline: naive coupled MLMC loses to standard MC here**
  (cost ratio ≈ 0.6× at ε = 0.025) — the expected β < γ pathology. This
  negative result is the point: it quantifies why rough volatility needs
  specialised estimators, and seeds publication P1 below.

**Extensions (ordered):**
1. **Antithetic coupling** (Giles–Szpruch style) adapted to the Volterra
   convolution — target: β > 2H empirically.
2. **Conditional MC / turbocharging** (McCrickerd–Pakkanen) as a control
   variate inside each level.
3. κ=1 hybrid coupling (needs the correlated nearest-cell Gaussian to be
   coupled across levels — non-trivial; design before coding).
4. Rough Heston MLMC (reuse the driver; new kernel).
5. Large-N weak-rate study to actually measure α (≥10⁶ samples/level).
6. MLMC for risk measures (nested simulation / market-risk direction —
   PhD-relevant).

## Layer 2 — Market frictions (spec)

**Goal:** non-linear execution frictions under rough vol; demonstrate the
breakdown of Markovian dynamic programming.

**Contents:** Almgren–Chriss temporary/permanent impact with closed-form
classical solutions as anchors; rough execution slippage (impact driven by
the rough variance path); empirical demonstration that conditioning on path
history changes the conditional law (non-Markovianity) — this motivates
Layer 3's signature features.

**Validation criteria:** reproduce Almgren–Chriss optimal trajectories
analytically in the classical limit; quantify Markov-projection error vs a
path-dependent benchmark.

**Key refs:** Almgren & Chriss (2001); Gatheral, Jaisson & Rosenbaum (2018).

## Layer 3 — RL hedging engine (spec)

**Goal:** risk-aware deep hedging on the non-Markovian state via path
signatures.

**Contents:** truncated signature features of (t, S, realised-var) path;
actor–critic with CVaR-sensitive objective; baselines: BS delta,
delta-vega, and the Layer 2 friction-aware strategies.

**Validation criteria:** recover BS delta (η→0, frictionless) within
tolerance; beat delta hedging on CVaR of terminal P&L under frictions with
statistical significance across seeds.

**Key refs:** Buehler et al. (2019); signature methods (Lyons; Kidger &
Lyons for ML practice).

## Layer 4 — Convergence & calibration (spec)

**Goal:** consolidated convergence study (weak/strong rates across layers)
and SPX smile calibration of rBergomi; reproduce BFG-style fits;
end-to-end reproducibility harness.

**Validation criteria:** calibrated (H, η, ρ) in the published
neighbourhood; documented seeds; one-command reproduction of every figure.

## Decisions log (append-only)

**2026-06-12**
- **D1** Layer 1b uses the κ=0 optimal-discretisation scheme, *not* κ=1:
  the process is then a pure function of Brownian increments, making the
  MLMC coupling exact by pairwise summation. κ=1 deferred (extension 3).
- **D2** Lognormal compensator uses the **discrete** variance
  v_i = 2H·dt·cumsum(g²), not t^{2H}: forward variance exact at every
  level; kills the bias class that broke Layer 1 (L1-1).
- **D3** MLMC driver floors rates at α ≥ 0.5, β ≥ 0.1 on *both* the
  regression and the externally-supplied path. Bug story: a
  noise-dominated regression returned α = −0.01, making 2^α − 1 < 0 and
  the bias test pass vacuously (L stuck at 2). Floors follow Giles'
  practice.
- **D4** ε schedule [0.20, 0.10, 0.05, 0.025] (quick: drop the last) —
  affordable in the β < γ worst regime.
- **D5** README + CITATION reframed from "PhD programme at
  Manchester/Oxford" (false, reputationally dangerous) to **independent
  research programme, University of Salford** (true, and a stronger story).
  Broken Zenodo DOI badge removed; DOI to be minted at first tagged
  release.
- **D6** `requirements.txt` added (numpy ≥1.24, scipy ≥1.10,
  matplotlib ≥3.7) — README referenced it but it didn't exist.
- **D7** (amended) Figures are committed flat at the repo root
  (`layer1b_beta_vs_H.png` etc.) — GitHub web upload flattens folders.
  Runtime figures still regenerate into `output/` locally.
- **D8** Per-level batch size capped at `2_560_000 // n_f` samples
  (floor 200): a fixed batch of 5000 at n = 4096 spiked peak RAM to ~2–3 GB
  and got the process OOM-killed. The cap keeps peak memory flat as levels
  deepen; estimator statistics are unaffected.
- **D9** GitHub web uploads (per-file downloads + manual renaming)
  cyclically scrambled names↔contents across all repo files and dropped
  `layer1_rough_vol.py`; repaired by re-uploading the full verified set in
  one commit. Adopted flat root layout. Future commits should go through a
  local git clone or Claude Code — file names and contents then travel
  together by construction.

## Publication seeds

- **P1 (ready to draft):** *"Is the pathwise bound tight? Naive multilevel
  Monte Carlo under rough Bergomi."* Empirical note: β ≈ 2H across
  H ∈ [0.05, 0.35] with exact κ=0 coupling; cost comparison showing naive
  MLMC ≤ standard MC in the practical regime; why the Asian average fails
  to smooth the Volterra error. Figures already exist (§2, §3, §4).
- **P2:** improved estimators — antithetic and conditional-MC couplings
  (extensions 1–2), benchmarked against P1's baseline.
- Long-range: MLMC for market-risk measures (nested estimation) — aligns
  with the PhD direction.

## Working agreement

1. Read this file before touching code. In Claude Code: **Plan Mode first**
   (Shift+Tab), subagents for diagnostics.
2. Append to the decisions log every session, with date and rationale.
3. Never declare anything "tested" or "ruled out" without having run that
   exact thing, by name, in that session.
4. Negative results are results. Claims in docstrings must match the
   evidence in `output/` — when they diverge, the docstring changes.
5. Commit messages reference the layer and decision IDs (e.g. "L1b: D3
   rate floors").
